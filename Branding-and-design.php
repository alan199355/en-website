				<p>
					In China, it is imperative to have a brand name that resonates with Chinese audiences, that positions you well in the market, and is easy to remember. Choosing a good brand identity shows you are taking your business in China seriously and allows your company to reap the benefits.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, many Chinese translations or transliterations of foreign brand names don’t cut the mustard. They often lack meaning and positive associations, making the company name hard to remember and signalling a lack of commitment to China.
				</p>
				<p>
					The holy grail of a good Chinese name reflects the sounds of the foreign name using Chinese characters that together have a real, appropriate and positive meaning in Chinese. Benchmark names are Coca-cola (可口可乐), Ikea (宜家) and Carrefour (家乐福) – all of which sound similar to the original, but more importantly sound great in Chinese.
				</p>
				<p>
					Likewise, brand logos or the corporate visual identity might not be suitable for China. The Chinese characters (or chosen name) needs to be incorporated into the logo, creating a brand identity unique to China while remaining consistent with the visual identity used elsewhere.
				</p>
				<p>

						The brief
					</h3>
					<p>
						It must be short. No more than four characters. It should be pronounced like the international Sveba-Dahlen even in Chinese. It should have a meaning that hints at the brand’s positioning as a leading maker of the highest quality professional ovens and baking equipment. The brands commitment to energy efficiency should be expressed.

						The process
					</h3>
					<p>
						We worked with both foreign and local managers over a three day intensive workshop. During the workshop, the problems and requirements were clearly defined and discussed. This collaborative approach allowed us to get a full understanding of Sveba-Dahlen’s brand message, background, competition and future needs. The second day is where the creativity truly began. Our creative team got to work, coming up with a range of proposals and explanations with the client. On the third day, we had a name which we checked with our partners specialising in trademark law.

						The result
					</h3>
					<p>
						The name we chose with our client was 斯巴达能. This Chinese name reflects the sound, with 达 meaning achieving and 能 representing Sveba-Dahlen’s energy-saving capabilities. After deciding on the name, we also incorporated the Chinese characters into the existing logo, and designed a range of letterheads, business cards, and templates so the design can be put straight into use. .
