				Chinese Interpretation Services
			</h1>
			<p>
				Lan-bridge provides Chinese interpreters in the UK and China, as well as in other countries across the world. We have a network of highly qualified linguists for interpreting in and out of Chinese and English here in the UK and between Chinese and
				a dozen other languages in China and abroad.
			</p>
			<p>
				We know you need to get your messages across clearly, so we will work with you to find the most suitable service type for your needs and to match you with the best interpreter for the subject matter. We help you pre-brief your interpreter, so that
				they are adequately prepared and understand your requirements, ensuring that everything runs smoothly on the day.
			</p>
			<p>
				Confidentiality is paramount and we and all of our interpreters sign confidentiality agreements as standard. We also provide equipment hire, telephone interpreting and other additional services as requested.
