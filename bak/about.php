				<h2>About us</h2>
				<p>Lan-bridge is a Chinese company with an international outlook. We were founded in 2000 to cater to the increasing demand for translation services as more and more foreign companies invested in China, and as Chinese companies began to cooperate with partners all over the globe.</p>
				<p>Lan-bridge sets high standards for itself and was the first translation company in China to be awarded the ISO9001:2000 quality management assurance certificate, which we renewed in 2013. We have been recognised three times as one of the top ten language service providers in China by the Translators Association of China, in 2009, 2010 and 2012. We are currently one of the largest translation companies in mainland China.</p>

				<h2>Cultural competence</h2>
				<p>We pride ourselves on being cultural intermediaries – allowing foreign firms access to China and allowing Chinese firms to make it on overseas soil. We know that success only happens when companies and customers can communicate, and we also know where the mistranslations and misunderstandings are likely to happen.  This means we can take proactive steps to solve communication issues before they occur, ensuring that even if you don’t have any Chinese staff, your messages will get across and you don’t need to worry about poor communication affecting your business in China.</p>
