		<h1>Mandarin Chinese Translations</h1>
		<p>
			We know you want to make an impact in China, but the Chinese market can be intimidating for newcomers and old-hands alike. Because of our Chinese expertise, we’re able to give a better service than generalist translation agencies. We can check your
					content and advise on how to approach your translation, pointing out sections and ideas that might not resonate with the Chinese reader and helping you change them, so you know you’ll get a translation that truly creates value and ROI, rather than
					just costing money.

					<h2>Example -- adapting your content for China</h2>
					<p>
						We will look at your project and identify areas that need adapting to meet the expectations and needs of Chinese users. Will the benefits of your product or service resonate with Chinese audiences? Would a different style or tone work better in
					Chinese? Is there any background knowledge that we need to explain? Do we need to localise any multimedia, formats or code?
					</p>
					<p>
						We adapt the translation so that it makes an impact with Chinese audiences by getting creative with certain words/sections
					or documents. For example, if you had a health care monitoring product aimed at middle class, middle-aged consumers which suggests gardening as a gentle and accesible way to stay healthy and active, we would know that the target consumers in China
					on the whole do not have gardens and that the suggestion would fall flat. Depending on the exact type of consumer, we might change it to an activity that reonsates with family-oriented Chinese consumers - perhaps playing with grandchildren - or a
					traditional Chinese exercise like tai chi.
					</p>
					<p>
						We offer a range of services to make sure that your content will work best in the Chinese market. Depending on your needs, we can research keywords and carry our on-page search engine optimisation. We can
					also provide copywriting for when you need origitinal content that taps in the Chinese zeitgeist, for example, for blogs, social media or advertising. We can even help you find appropriate names for your brand, services or products.
