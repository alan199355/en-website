				Transverbum Partners is a global network of collaborating language companies, 
				each with its own specialties, and all with a focus on multilingual 
				communications and transcreation. Because we are a networked organization, 
				we will always employ the best possible local resources in each market, 
				avoiding the risks of substandard service and heavy overheads. Our translation
				 hubs are Stockholm, Chengdu, London and Chicago.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many web site and marketing translation tasks will simply not be done right 
				without professionals located in the target market. Language is a precious 
				and perishable item for which meaning and nuances will frequently change. 
				This fact – and to handle the all-important quality assurance – offers 
				compelling reasons for using the very best people, regardless of location. 
				All our translators are professionals who translate into their native language 
				only.
